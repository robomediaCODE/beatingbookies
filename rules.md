### Rules:
1. **Proposal and Acceptance:** One user proposes the side bet by choosing a game and predicting an outcome. Another user accepts the bet by predicting the opposite outcome.
2. **Outcome and Scoring:**
 - If the proposing user's prediction is correct: +1 point to the proposer and -1 point to the acceptor.
 - If the proposing user's prediction is incorrect: -1 point to the proposer and +1 point to the acceptor.
3. **Limit:** The number of side bets one can engage in is limited by the number of games in a given week.
4. **Negative Scoring:** Users can go negative in total points.
